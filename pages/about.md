### Hi, I'm Tapio Salonen!

Currently I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Helsinki and my passion is all related to computers. Fullstack development, Cyber Security and DevOps are close to my hearth and I'm constantly developing my skills in those areas.

This website is made for learning purposes. I want to improve my ability to write texts in English and share my programming knowledge etc to everyone who needs it.

Source of this website is divided to two repositories
* [Source code](https://github.com/tsa-dom/gh-pages)
* [Blog articles](https://github.com/tsa-dom/contents)

If you find any typos or factual errors feel free to contribute.
