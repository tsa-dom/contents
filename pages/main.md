#### Blog platform hosted by Github Pages

This blog platform is made for learning purposes. Publishing blog posts is my opportunity to practice writing in English and your opportunity to learn new things from me. The topics on this site focus on Computer Science and programming.

The source of this website is separated in two different repositories
* [Source code](https://github.com/tsa-dom/gh-pages)
* [Blog articles](https://github.com/tsa-dom/contents)

There will soon be a third repository where I am going to store example apps, that I will go through in my blog posts.

This website is continuously developing. If you find any typos or factual errors feel free to contribute. I am going to add contribution introductions soon to its own tab. My plan is to add a new blog post every week on Tuesday, but I reserve rights to modify the publishing schedule.

I am going to add contribution introductions later to this website on its own tab.
